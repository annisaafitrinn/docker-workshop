# docker-workshop
This repository contains my hands-on practice while following a Docker course.
It covers containerizing a Python data pipeline, running PostgreSQL with Docker, orchestrating services with Docker Compose, and ingesting the NY Taxi dataset using pandas and SQLAlchemy.
The goal of this project was to understand Docker concepts (images, containers, volumes, networking) through practical implementation.
